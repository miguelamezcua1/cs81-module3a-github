# Reflection

## What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?

I learned how to use Git and GitHub to create a repository, track my code, and make commits. I understand how to keep changes organized and how version control works in a real coding project.

## What was most confusing or frustrating?

At first I was confused about what Git and GitHub actually do. There are a lot of new terms and steps. But once I created the repo and started adding files, it became easier to understand.

## Why do you think developers use Git?

I think developers use Git to keep track of changes in their code and avoid losing work. It also helps teams work together and see who changed what.

## How might this help with larger projects in the future?

In big projects with lots of files or people, Git can help organize everything and let you go back if you make a mistake. Itâ€™s also good for backing up your work.
